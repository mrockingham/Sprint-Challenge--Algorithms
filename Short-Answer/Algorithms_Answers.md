#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) 0(n) as the input grows the runtime should grow with it


b) 0(n^2) has two loops based off n


c)0(N) this function looks to be recrsive. it rns once each time or however many times n is

## Exercise II


Starting at the middle floor drop the egg if the 'egg' retuns broken

start again at f - 1 and keep going until it returns not broken

if start at middle floor and egg does not break f+1 untill egg breaks

the runtime would be 0(log n)
